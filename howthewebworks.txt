   //part 2


1. Using ***curl***, make a ***GET*** request to the *icanhazdadjoke.com* API
   to find all jokes involving the word “pirate”

curl https://icanhazdadjoke.com/search?term=pirates

2. Use ***dig*** to find what the IP address is for *icanhazdadjoke.com*

in git //$   dig icanhazdadjoke.com

3. Make a simple web page and serve it using ***python3 -m http.server***.
   Visit the page in a browser.

cd into your files or page on git, than serve it by python3 -m http.server you will
then get a port number to your server.

   //part 3 


1.Build a very simple HTML form that uses the GET method
 (it can use the same page URL for the action) when the form is submitted.



2.Add a field or two to the form and, after submitting it, explore in Chrome 
  Developer tools how you can view the request and response headers.



3.Edit the page to change the form type to POST, refresh in the browser and 
re-submit. Do you still see the field in the query string? Explore in Chrome
how you can view the request and response headers, as well as the form data.




//part 4


1.At times, it’s useful for your JavaScript to look at the URL of the browser
 window and change how the script works depending on parts of that
(particularly the query string).

2.[Read about the URL API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL)



3.Try some of the code examples in the Chrome Console so that you can get
 comfortable with the basic methods and properties for instances of the URL class.
